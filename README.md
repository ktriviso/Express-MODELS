# HOMEWORK: PRACTICE WITH MODELS AND ROUTES!!!

Your instructors has decided to open a pizza restaurant: Pizza Express!! However, the developer they hired to build the site left it unfinished. Right now it has the beginning of a server, but there's no database attached yet. Oh no!

Your task is to build out the database and the models. Good luck, Developer!

### Setup

- Create a database `pizza_dev`. You **must** name your database this in order for things to work later on. Run the migration and seed files -- `psql -d pizza_dev -f [path to file here]`
- Run `npm install` within `pizza-express` directory to install all the dependencies. (Note: The app will not work at this point. Your job is to get it working.)
- Fill out `config/connection.js`, `config/dbConfig.js`, `models/pizza.js`, and `routes/pizza-routes.js`  . Don't copy and paste! We will _know_.
- Put every error you run into in the `errors.md` file.


## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- You have a complete `config/connection.js`, `config/dbConfig.js`, `models/pizza.js`.
- Your `server.js` and `routes/pizza-routes` files have been commented on every line.
- Your `errors.md` has its errors filled in.

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.
